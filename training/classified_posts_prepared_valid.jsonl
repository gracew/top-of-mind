{"prompt":"It's been absolutely gut-wrenching to witness the scenes of chaos and desperation play out in Afghanistan over the past few days. From 2005-2012, Afghanistan was the primary focus of my career - as an Army infantry officer in a frontline unit deployed to one of the most violent regions of the country and subsequently as a civilian field researcher\/consultant focused on economic development. Over the years, I've made deep friendships with Afghans of many different stripes - interpreters, security forces, local leaders, journalists, entrepreneurs, and their families. The people are incredible, their culture is beautiful, and their potential is unlimited. Moreover, their perseverance amidst decades of war, courage in the face of daily threats to their lives and livelihoods, and commitment to a better future is truly inspirational. Unfortunately, their leadership largely did not embody these qualities and ended up failing and betraying them. The US role was a very mixed bag. There's plenty of blame to go around. But I'll save my political analysis for another platform and another time. Because first and foremost, the complete bungling of our withdrawal is creating a human tragedy of the highest order. Infuriating in how avoidable it was, but still not too late to fix. In recent days, I and many other veterans are doing our best to help terrified Afghan friends urgently confronted with terrible choices - risking their lives to travel to Kabul Airport in the slim hopes of getting a ticket out of the country or hunkering down in their homes, anxiously awaiting the inevitable Taliban to knock on their door, and hoping for the best\/preparing for the worst. Given the current state of affairs, the US must urgently fix our completely broken Special Immigrant Visa program, urgently increase the number of available slots, and urgently evacuate not just US personnel but additionally our highly vulnerable Afghan allies.

{"prompt":"All good things must come to an end.  After 6.5 years being part of the Victorian Public Service, I have resigned and will be starting a  new role after a short break.  My time within the service has been fantastic & I encourage anyone interested in working in a purpose-driven organisation to consider the public service. The opportunity for direct impact across so many important issues for our community is immense. For me the public service allowed me to use what I had learned across start-ups and large corporates in a whole new context.      During my time within the VPS, I led my team to: - Develop the technology response to the Royal Commission into Family Violence.  - created 3 whole of gov platforms, the first elements of our digital infrastructure - Change the approach to public engagement through engage.vic. - Made Victoria API first and delivered whole of Government API infrastructure - Created Single Digital Presence an open sources publishing that not only changes the way Victoria approaches its web presence but is having an impact nationally  - Proposed National API standards & delivered these with the DTA. - Created Developer.vic & API marketplace to make collaboration easier and grow our digital economy   - Delivered key aspects of Victoria’s COVID response including the QR Code system, vouchers & permits, automation and web presence  - Adoption of Human Centred Design within the VPS & produced tools like our HCD Playbook.   - Shake up traditional approaches to government service delivery through programs like Pick My Project, Budget.vic, Budget Hack and more.   Digital Victoria is the vehicle that brings together everything I have learnt from delivering these programs. It takes into account the complexity of the environment we work within, the need to improve the approach to assurance and governance and most importantly getting public service to think of digital as a connected ecosystem.  Pitching the Digital Victoria concept and leading the development of the Digital Victoria business case was fitting for the last program I led within Vic Gov.  I have been lucky to have had some great partners along the way. Today, Salsa Digital, KPMG Australia, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Portable, @wearehuddle, Paper Giant, Deloitte Digital, Axway, Google Cloud, Wunderman, Luna Tractor, Katalyst Interactive, Harvest Digital Planning, VERSA Agency Geoplex amazee.io But of all the things I am most proud of from my time within Government, it’s the team we have created together. For me, this team is truly about driving innovation through trust & diversity. I have been purposeful about bringing together individuals with diverse experiences, be it culture, work experience, life or ability to give us a unique perspective about the work we do. Together we achieved so much.  As I leave the public service I am proud of what we have done and look forward to seeing what the team does next.  #digitaltransfomation #innovation #change #change ->","completion":" c"}

{"prompt":"Back in 1996 I started the first-ever e-commerce blinds store. My kids were 6, 11 and 13. My wife, Naomi, died a few years later.

{"prompt":"Is ego-dissolution always a positive experience? Dread of ego-dissolution is one of the factors of the Altered States Questionnaire (Dittrich, 1998) which is one of the most widely used subjective measures of the psychedelic state. Dread of ego-dissolution is considered to entice negative, anxiety laden experiences and are often associated with what people might label as “bad trips”. It includes items measuring negatively experienced depersonalisation, cognitive disturbances, paranoia and anxiety over loss of thought and body control. It is also important to note that although this factor is named dread of ego-dissolution, it only captures limited aspects of the ego-dissolution experience. In a study conducted by Roseman, Nutt & Carhart-Harris (2018), the dread of ego-dissolution factor in psilocybin sessions was found to be negatively related to long-term positive outcomes in treatment-resistant depression. On the other hand, psilocybin experiences that shared features with the Oceanic Boundlessness factor of the scale (and are more similar to the mystical-type experience) were found to be more positively related to long-term positive outcomes. Dread of ego-dissolution was reported less than the feelings of unity associated with Oceanic Boundlessness.
