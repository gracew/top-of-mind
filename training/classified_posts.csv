A,"Being turned down for a role hurts, but don't let it define or discourage you. Learn from it, but don't dwell on it. Brighter days are ahead. . . . Early in my career, I was turned down by two FAANG companies. It stung, especially when I saw some of my classmates getting hired by these tech giants. I persisted and eventually landed at a small tech company focused on government contracting. Although I loved the variety of projects that I had the opportunity to participate in and enjoyed using tech to help people, I felt that I wasn't good enough because a tech giant didn't hire me. Flash forward to today. I've transitioned into engineering leadership and am responsible for cultivating the next generation of engineering leaders. I do cutting-edge work that positively impacts people's lives in meaningful ways. It took me years to figure it out, but I eventually realized that I love working in smaller companies that allow me to wear different hats and have a diversity of tasks. I love what I do and would never trade these opportunities. To the future rockstars out there who are just a few months out of college or boot camp, keep grinding, building, and learning.

Thanks Bain & Company for creating some of those small moments. How are you staying energised to get through these times and tackle the bigger issues around us?"
C,"More than a decade ago, a group of engineering students and friends started working around the idea of building a social marketplace. Back then, most people were afraid of buying things over the internet. Our thinking was that the “social distance” in the social graph could have been leveraged as a relevant indicator of trust, to eventually facilitate transactions. The marketplace never took off, but some of us continued running experiments around our merchant’s feedback, until we managed to understand that some of them wanted more personalization and control around their digital presence. After some prototyping, ""Nuvemshop | Tiendanube"" was born as a simple platform to help merchants build an online store, and to help them connect directly with their consumers. Ten years into the future, we are seeing D2C happen at a massive pace all over the world, and Nuvemshop has become the go-to platform for LATAM merchants to be successful. We have been privileged enough to partner with an amazing group of people: merchants, partners, advisors, investors, and team, and we now have even more resources to continue building infrastructure for the decade to come. The essence remains unchanged: to help everyone out there to convert passion projects into thriving businesses."

C,"I was delighted to receive a care package from the Coding it Forward fellowship, thanking me for mentoring and advising our country's next generation of civic technologists. The gesture is highly appreciated though wholly unnecessary since helping the fellows out was my pleasure and privilege. It is ironic that the fellows asked me for career advice, since the truth is that I wouldn't even be a competitive applicant for an internship as prestigious as Coding it Forward when I was in college. As fellows, these students have earned the privilege of being deliberate and thoughtful about their career path in ways that I never was, and I felt they deserved to know that. I highlighted my career trajectory so that they could avoid my mistakes and propel themselves only towards the success they deserve. Most of all, I wanted them to know that the pursuit of good, honest work that you can be proud of is always worth it. I'm honored to have played a small part in this summer cohort's story, and I look forward to seeing what they accomplish next."

I will focus on ethical/bias implications in ML, AI fairness, and interpretable machine learning. As a first-generation college graduate from a low-income refugee family raised in Las Vegas during the 2008 financial crisis, survival in America felt precarious, high-stakes, and at times impossible all at once. So much hung in the balance with every step I took. The support of family, friends, colleagues, professors, organizing community, and mentors whose collective belief in me outmeasured my own made each stride feel lighter and possible. Not in my or my ancestors’ wildest dreams would I imagine that steps along that winding path would lead me through Harvard University's ivory gates and beyond. In Vietnamese, there is a proverb that goes: ""Ăn quả nhớ kẻ trồng cây."" This directly translates to — ""When eating fruit, think of those who planted the tree.""

A,"Last week was one of my first back at Lyft after over 18 weeks on parental leave.  Yep, 18 weeks.  For a dad.  Being able to take such a meaningful amount of time to celebrate the arrival of our daughter Izzy left me immensely grateful.  I feel so fortunate to work at a place that recognizes the profound impact on parents when they can be fully present with a newborn, on a company when their employees come back feeling refreshed and grateful after tending to what really matters and on society when parents are able to truly bond with their new arrival. While I certainly have Logan, John and Kristin to thank for instilling this mindset and culture into Lyft, I’m equally appreciative of the support I’ve received at every level of the organization - from peers, direct reports, skip levels and casual office passersby.   This encouragement had a meaningful effect on me - to silence the societal stigma about men stepping away from work for their families and to help push back against my own tendencies. And thanks to all this support, I also came to realize that my leave was a part of something much bigger - that it wasn’t just important to everyone that I take time with my growing family - but also that I set the right tone so that others would feel comfortable doing so when their time came.   To do my small part to help normalize time with family. I’ve talked to enough friends, coworkers and family to know how incredibly lucky I am to have this kind of benefit.   My experience has made me a huge proponent for it, but also know that not every company is in a position to provide it or that everyone can actually take advantage. So my advocacy is mostly a grateful dad saying that it “meant a lot” and that being able to take real time away from fast-paced job and a team of nearly 30 is a rare gift that's had an unforgettable impact.   Finally, I wouldn't even be talking about this without my incredible team shouldering the burden during my leave, no questions asked.   Christopher, Lamont, Michael, Kevin - I’m eternally grateful!"

A,"It's been absolutely gut-wrenching to witness the scenes of chaos and desperation play out in Afghanistan over the past few days. From 2005-2012, Afghanistan was the primary focus of my career - as an Army infantry officer in a frontline unit deployed to one of the most violent regions of the country and subsequently as a civilian field researcher/consultant focused on economic development. Over the years, I've made deep friendships with Afghans of many different stripes - interpreters, security forces, local leaders, journalists, entrepreneurs, and their families. The people are incredible, their culture is beautiful, and their potential is unlimited. Moreover, their perseverance amidst decades of war, courage in the face of daily threats to their lives and livelihoods, and commitment to a better future is truly inspirational. Unfortunately, their leadership largely did not embody these qualities and ended up failing and betraying them. The US role was a very mixed bag. There's plenty of blame to go around. But I'll save my political analysis for another platform and another time. Because first and foremost, the complete bungling of our withdrawal is creating a human tragedy of the highest order. Infuriating in how avoidable it was, but still not too late to fix. In recent days, I and many other veterans are doing our best to help terrified Afghan friends urgently confronted with terrible choices - risking their lives to travel to Kabul Airport in the slim hopes of getting a ticket out of the country or hunkering down in their homes, anxiously awaiting the inevitable Taliban to knock on their door, and hoping for the best/preparing for the worst. Given the current state of affairs, the US must urgently fix our completely broken Special Immigrant Visa program, urgently increase the number of available slots, and urgently evacuate not just US personnel but additionally our highly vulnerable Afghan allies. The public is watching. The world is watching. History is watching."

As an event host/mc/moderator I have to be 100% switched all the time. - I have to be super present with the audience and the speakers on stage. - I have to effectively work with sound, video, stage and studio teams. - I have to remember countless names and notes. - I have to be ready for the unexpected and handle it effortlessly. - I need to simultaneously talk, while watching monitors and listening to producers in my in-ear piece.

COVID, and more importantly the government response to the pandemic, simply compounded that uncertainty. Not surprisingly, anybody who can is sitting on cash, despite abysmal rates of return.... because cash is still king. ""Cash and short-term investments on corporate balance sheets globally are at an all-time high of $6.84 trillion, according to data from S&P Global, extrapolated from second-quarter earnings reports. That is 45% higher than the average in the five years preceding the pandemic and a 2.6% increase from the previous quarter."" #economy #business"

A,"A couple years back, revenue-based financing (RBF) was starting to pick up some steam and garner a lot of interest in the media and with Founders. The hype had hit! As the anti-Hype Man I seemingly have become, I built and shared an open-source RBF model meant to help folks actually understand core RBF mechanics. I also wrote a pretty comprehensive post on RBF: https://lnkd.in/gTX7c3c4 Since then, I’ve connected with a steady stream of folks who have questions on the model and RBF in general. It’s been a decent enough evergreen marketing asset that seems to have provided folks with some intel they didn’t previously have. Kind of what I expected it to do, so all good. In the past few weeks, something I didn’t expect has happened a few times. People starting up new RBF funds have reached out because they’ve run across the model. So what? Someone wants to glom on to my experience and milk me for information? Don’t be such a skeptic. This outreach was unique in that it came from groups on 3 continents, all of whom are looking to deploy RBF to deliver impact while generating strong financial returns. One group is in South Africa - I spent a month there 12 years ago, loved it. Maybe this can get me back over there. One is supporting refugees in Georgia - I used to volunteer with the refugee community in Denver. Have not done so in years, maybe this can be a catalyst to get me back into it. One is in Colombia - My wife’s family is from Colombia. My kids are 1/4th Colombian. I have a Colombian national team soccer kit. Sure, why not hop on a call?! Point being, these interactions are of interest not only b/c of their unexpectedness (no need to look it up, I did, it’s a word) but more so b/c they are not my day-to-day, not really overlapping with Bigfoot, and have some tangential relationship to my personal life. So, I’ve determined they’re worth a bit of my time to see if I can provide some support beyond a spreadsheet and blog post I put on the internet 2 years ago. Anyways, it got me thinking a bit about unexpected benefits that can come along with sharing your knowledge and experience (a scary thing for a lot of us). Beyond building brand awareness and advocacy, which the model has done, it’s now serving as a mechanism for me and our team to potentially involve ourselves with people and missions that span well beyond Bigfoot’s focus. We’re not going to lend in Africa or South America or to a refugee run manufacturing company. It’s just not what we do. But, we have some operational know-how that may enable us to contribute to groups directly doing so. I think that’s pretty cool.  You never know what can happen when you take a bit of time to share your knowledge in a practical format. You may just help others succeed and open up some new avenues for your own growth. #capitalraising #financeandeconomy #finance #financialmodeling #revenuebasedfinancing Bigfoot Capital"

""The key is that a depression, in our view, is not the same as a long and large recession, but is rather a different phenomenon entirely. Normal economic linkages are maintained in recessions, but break down during depressions… In both [the US in the 1930s and Japan’s current deflationary depression] monetary policy (falling interest rates) failed to stimulate economic growth or financial markets, leading to an unmanaged economic contraction in which central bank control is very limited."" - Bridgewater Associates #markets #economy #interestrates #investments #investing #economics #wealthmanagement #wealth"

C,"All good things must come to an end.  After 6.5 years being part of the Victorian Public Service, I have resigned and will be starting a  new role after a short break.  My time within the service has been fantastic & I encourage anyone interested in working in a purpose-driven organisation to consider the public service. The opportunity for direct impact across so many important issues for our community is immense. For me the public service allowed me to use what I had learned across start-ups and large corporates in a whole new context.      During my time within the VPS, I led my team to: - Develop the technology response to the Royal Commission into Family Violence.  - created 3 whole of gov platforms, the first elements of our digital infrastructure - Change the approach to public engagement through engage.vic. - Made Victoria API first and delivered whole of Government API infrastructure - Created Single Digital Presence an open sources publishing that not only changes the way Victoria approaches its web presence but is having an impact nationally  - Proposed National API standards & delivered these with the DTA. - Created Developer.vic & API marketplace to make collaboration easier and grow our digital economy   - Delivered key aspects of Victoria’s COVID response including the QR Code system, vouchers & permits, automation and web presence  - Adoption of Human Centred Design within the VPS & produced tools like our HCD Playbook.   - Shake up traditional approaches to government service delivery through programs like Pick My Project, Budget.vic, Budget Hack and more.   Digital Victoria is the vehicle that brings together everything I have learnt from delivering these programs. It takes into account the complexity of the environment we work within, the need to improve the approach to assurance and governance and most importantly getting public service to think of digital as a connected ecosystem.  Pitching the Digital Victoria concept and leading the development of the Digital Victoria business case was fitting for the last program I led within Vic Gov.  I have been lucky to have had some great partners along the way. Today, Salsa Digital, KPMG Australia, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Portable, @wearehuddle, Paper Giant, Deloitte Digital, Axway, Google Cloud, Wunderman, Luna Tractor, Katalyst Interactive, Harvest Digital Planning, VERSA Agency Geoplex amazee.io But of all the things I am most proud of from my time within Government, it’s the team we have created together. For me, this team is truly about driving innovation through trust & diversity. I have been purposeful about bringing together individuals with diverse experiences, be it culture, work experience, life or ability to give us a unique perspective about the work we do. Together we achieved so much.  As I leave the public service I am proud of what we have done and look forward to seeing what the team does next.  #digitaltransfomation #innovation #change #change"

That’s because companies put the cart before the horse, focusing on a specific technology (“we need a machine-learning strategy!”) rather than doing the hard work of fitting the change into the overall business strategy first. Not only should they align tech investments with business goal, they should also lean more on insider knowledge than outside consultants, acknowledge fears about job loss that those insiders may have, develop deep knowledge of how changes will affect customer experience, and use experimentation, prototyping, etc. to facilitate change. https://lnkd.in/d9EB44XY #technology #digitaltransformation #artificialintelligence #innovation #machinelearning #ai"

A,"How temporary will the recent and sharp decline in consumer sentiment be due to the rise of the Delta variant? We don't know. According to the University of Michigan's results from its early August survey: ""Consumers have correctly reasoned that the economy's performance will be diminished over the next several months, but the extraordinary surge in negative economic assessments also reflects an emotional response, mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end. In the months ahead, it is likely that consumers will again voice more reasonable expectations, and with control of the Delta variant, shift toward outright optimism."" Civic Science is also showing increased concern with their own August data: ""This week, nearly 80% of the population is concerned about the variant – with nearly half reporting they are 'very concerned'...Employers and businesses are beginning to require proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test for employees to return to work. As of right now, more adults agree than disagree that proof of COVID-19 vaccination should be required to go to work."" Meanwhile, over at Morning Consult for the month of July: ""Overall, sentiment declined in 41 of 50 states. With consumer sentiment rising in only eight states, July marks the worst month for state-level gains since November 2020 when the third wave was roaring through the U.S. and only four states experienced an increase in consumer confidence."" However, The Conference Board's own Consumer Confidence Index for July showed no such change (probably because their own survey was taken before the rise in Delta variants became daily news): ""Consumers’ appraisal of present-day conditions held steady, suggesting economic growth in Q3 is off to a strong start. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook didn’t waver, and they continued to expect that business conditions, jobs, and personal financial prospects will improve."" It wouldn't surprise me to find out that the sharp drop in August is due largely to pandemic fatigue, with many consumers wondering, ""Is this ever going to end?"" Yes, but because the country didn't come together to achieve herd immunity quickly, while the pandemic will end, Covid-19 is here to stay, and will likely be managed appropriately as it becomes less lethal.

C,"More than a decade ago, a group of engineering students and friends started working around the idea of building a social marketplace. Back then, most people were afraid of buying things over the internet. Our thinking was that the “social distance” in the social graph could have been leveraged as a relevant indicator of trust, to eventually facilitate transactions. The marketplace never took off, but some of us continued running experiments around our merchant’s feedback, until we managed to understand that some of them wanted more personalization and control around their digital presence. After some prototyping, ""Nuvemshop | Tiendanube"" was born as a simple platform to help merchants build an online store, and to help them connect directly with their consumers. Ten years into the future, we are seeing D2C happen at a massive pace all over the world, and Nuvemshop has become the go-to platform for LATAM merchants to be successful. We have been privileged enough to partner with an amazing group of people: merchants, partners, advisors, investors, and team, and we now have even more resources to continue building infrastructure for the decade to come. The essence remains unchanged: to help everyone out there to convert passion projects into thriving businesses."

A,"Back in 1996 I started the first-ever e-commerce blinds store. My kids were 6, 11 and 13. My wife, Naomi, died a few years later. Her passing triggered something in me I never thought I had. It was a wake-up call. I had a bigger calling than just being an entrepreneur.  Twenty-one years later, I sold Blindscom to Home Depot. What a journey it was.  It started with working out of a van, to a garage, to a musty rat-infested office with an alleyway entrance, to eventually building it to hundreds of millions in revenue and eventual sale. What I learned from these 21 years is something I will always cherish. I can only hope to pass it forward to anyone who wants to become a better leader. It came down to the “Four Es.” A set of guiding principles that helped me overcome any obstacle to my organization’s success: → Evolve Continuously → Experiment Without Fear of Failure → Express Yourself → Enjoy the Ride I’ll be writing more on this topic, but I wanted to say thank you to everyone who had a part in this journey. I hope I can give back 10x what was given to me. #values #leadership #family #givingback"

A,"Came across this whilst catching up on reading in the Economist. In 1988 ludmila ulitskaya wrote a screenplay about an epidemic as part of her application for a film-making course in Moscow. When she was rejected, she filed the script away; 32 years later covid-19 erupted and she dug it out again. “Just the Plague”, published last year in Russian and now translated into English by Polly Gannon, is based on the true story of a plague outbreak in Moscow in 1939, caused by a scientist accidentally infecting himself as he worked on a vaccine. Sounds all to familiar. Tinatin Japaridze"
A,"A Chinese gene company selling #prenatal tests around the world developed them in collaboration with the country's #military and is using them to collect #genetic #data from millions of #women for sweeping research on the traits of populations, a #Reuters review of scientific papers and company statements found. DNA data collected from prenatal tests on women outside China has been found to be also stored in China’s government-funded #gene #database, one of the world’s largest, the company confirmed. BGI, in which the Shenzhen city government and Beijing's largest state investment vehicle took stakes in 2014, runs that gene bank. #NATO has warned China's assertive behavior is a systemic challenge, and #Beijing has drawn sanctions for alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang and stepped up a national security crackdown in Hong Kong.   Being able to understand how physical characteristics relate to a gene – and thus figuring out what genes actually do – “really is the cutting edge of genomics,” said Puglisi, who worked on biosecurity issues in the U.S. government. “When you can combine large amounts of #genomic #data – including mothers and their unborn children – with their medical data and history, it is really powerful.” Reuters reviewed more than 100 documents, from research papers to marketing materials, to determine the scope of data being captured by BGI through its prenatal tests, how it is using this in its research and its military collaboration. Reuters also interviewed more than two dozen scientists and experts in genetic law, including researchers who worked with the company, as well as four women, in Poland, Spain and Thailand, who took the tests. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center ( #NCSC) told Reuters in response to this report that it had “serious concerns” over how genetic data is “collected, transmitted, stored and used” by China’s government and companies.  The NCSC, which issues public warnings on intelligence threats to the United States, has said China’s collection of healthcare data from America poses serious risks, not only to privacy, but also to U.S. economic and national security. It urged health institutions to carefully assess risks associated with sharing such data with Chinese companies, and for patients to be told about the “value and sensitivity” of their genetic information – and the risks associated with turning it over. Women taking the #NIFTY test outside China should be concerned about the privacy terms that allow data to be shared with Chinese national #security agencies, the center said. “Non-invasive #prenatal testing kits marketed by Chinese biotech firms serve an important medical function, but they can also provide another mechanism for the #People’sRepublicChina and Chinese biotech companies to collect genetic and genomic data from around the globe,” the center said."

A,"Lessons in sustaining their economy, their businesses, and keeping their community healthy during the pandemic: “with many other industries hurting in a state largely built on seasonal industries, closing salmon fishing season— which is estimated by a recent study to bring in $2 billion annually—would have resulted in a wide-reaching economic blow. Safety protocols were finally agreed on just weeks before the start of the season. Testing, travel regulations, quarantining, and masking were mandated, and the measures were put in place in all areas of the fishery. Processing plants operated strictly as closed campuses. Fishermen were quarantined on their boats in the boatyards. Once a crew was at sea, it stayed at sea; there was no returning to the docks or sending people into town. The port was closed to the public—as it continued to be this year. When a crew aboard a fishing vessel contracted COVID-19 in Dillingham, the boat was hauled into the boatyard and surrounded with yellow caution tape like a crime scene. With all the safety measures in place, it was just a matter of waiting. “We were waiting for the big burst to happen,” says Tilden. “But it didn’t happen."" #COVID #COMMUNITY National Geographic #fishing"

I highlighted my career trajectory so that they could avoid my mistakes and propel themselves only towards the success they deserve.

WORRY: “Worry happens in our minds and tends to be repetitive, obsessive.”  - Melanie Greenberg, author of the The Stress-Proof Brain” Worrying can calm our brains down and help us to problem-solve, but take these 3 steps to limit it: (a) Give yourself a worry “budget” (b) Push yourself to come up with a next step (c) Write your worries down  2. STRESS: ”Stress is a reaction to environmental changes or forces that exceed the individual’s resources.” - Dr. Greenberg   Here are 3 things to limit it:  (a) Go exercise!  (b) Get clear on what you can actually CONTROL (c) Don’t compare your stress with others 3. ANXIETY: If stress and worry are the symptoms, anxiety is the culmination. We experience anxiety in both our mind and our body. 3 things to help your anxiety: (a) Limit your sugar, alcohol and caffeine intake (b) Refocus in your body, center your breath, check in with your toes. Break the loop. (c) You can't think your way out of anxiety attack.

A,"How Drones Aid Firefighting? Fly over buildings and obstacles, and see-through smoke with thermal cameras to help prioritize targets Stream live video intelligence back to command centers to align teams and eliminate the uncertainty. Leverage high-resolution cameras to remotely monitor remaining threats and document damage for future analysis. A drone swarm using a relocatable servicing platform could be instantly deployed enabling a quick response and used both during the day and at night, in all visibility conditions, without the requirement of a nearby available water basin. Consider that in most countries, for safety reasons, firefighting aircraft can only fly during the day and are able to perform a limited number of water drops per hour due to the distance from a water refueling site. Is this the future of fire fighting? #innovation #artificialintelligence #drones"

A,"I had a fan girl moment while attended one of the #hpair2021 sessions featuring Ponsi Trivisvavet, CEO of Inari, rising Ag-Tech company based in US. Her take on how to help low-income farmers touch my heart a lot. It would require: - the helps from players from the whole supply chain - 10,000 entrepreneurs to help 100 million farmers - people to change perspective when looking at innovation as expensive. Innovation should be cheap and accessible I also appreciate one of her answer to the topic of being women entrepreneur. She emphasized that to her the problem is #selfdoubt. I strongly agree with this. Its not how people look at you, its how you believe in what you can do that is the limit.

Machine learning is quickly becoming a key ingredient in emerging products and technologies. This has caused the field to rapidly mature as it attempts to transform the process of building ML models from an art to an engineering practice. Yet, there is still a disconnect between research and production environments to ensure a reliable experience for customers and engineers alike. This piece outlines three pillars of reliability: observability, management of change, and incidence response to create a systematic reliability program.

She taught me many valuable lessons about advocating for others and inspired me to chase my dreams. My mom had a degree in social work, and worked in counseling for many years before joining the US Postal Service. She managed to work full-time while raising myself and my brothers, and took in two other children whose parents were unable to care for them. She always thought of others and how she could help shape their lives in a positive way. She has been gone now for 49 days. I will treasure this cover announcement as a reminder of her impact and sacrifice, and by the women all across this city. Congrats to the 78 women featured and to all the mothers raising daughters to believe that they too can change the world for the better."

A,"The Myth of the Girl Boss. Too often female CEOs are portrayed as having it all – smarts, ambition, super polished look, and ninja like multitasking abilities. I say more power to those women, if they actually exist. The reality – at least for me – is much messier. I work long hours looking anything but glamorous. Multitasking for me often involves doing a lot of things half-ass but at least getting them done, reading financial reports while waiting in the carpool line at my daughter’s school, squeezing in a webinar on how to format excel spreadsheets while doing the laundry, and the list goes on. I’m often travelling for work – not business class on Delta hanging out in the Sky Club Lounge – but driving a used hybrid to visit our stores, warehouse, and candy plant. I count inventory at our warehouse during our annual inventory count. And I work trade shows along with the rest of our small but mighty team – pushing to sell pecan log rolls and turn this scrappy company around, one new retail account at a time. I’m posting this so other women who see the picture-perfect moments on LinkedIn know that there are lots of unglamorous moments behind-the-scenes. But, flashy or not, it’s those moments that count."

I will focus on ethical/bias implications in ML, AI fairness, and interpretable machine learning. As a first-generation college graduate from a low-income refugee family raised in Las Vegas during the 2008 financial crisis, survival in America felt precarious, high-stakes, and at times impossible all at once. So much hung in the balance with every step I took. The support of family, friends, colleagues, professors, organizing community, and mentors whose collective belief in me outmeasured my own made each stride feel lighter and possible. Not in my or my ancestors’ wildest dreams would I imagine that steps along that winding path would lead me through Harvard University's ivory gates and beyond.

Dread of ego-dissolution is considered to entice negative, anxiety laden experiences and are often associated with what people might label as “bad trips”. It includes items measuring negatively experienced depersonalisation, cognitive disturbances, paranoia and anxiety over loss of thought and body control. It is also important to note that although this factor is named dread of ego-dissolution, it only captures limited aspects of the ego-dissolution experience. In a study conducted by Roseman, Nutt & Carhart-Harris (2018), the dread of ego-dissolution factor in psilocybin sessions was found to be negatively related to long-term positive outcomes in treatment-resistant depression. On the other hand, psilocybin experiences that shared features with the Oceanic Boundlessness factor of the scale (and are more similar to the mystical-type experience) were found to be more positively related to long-term positive outcomes. Dread of ego-dissolution was reported less than the feelings of unity associated with Oceanic Boundlessness.

A,"As we prepare to open our seven-story dedicated cancer facility next year, we have asked our patients to take a leading role in shaping the care journey to ensure we create the healing environment they look for. We have established a Patient and Family Advisory Council with cancer patients, survivors and their families and have involved them in every aspect of this journey, from how to design patient care areas to the development of wellness programs for the cancer center.   We have also created mock-up exam rooms for cancer patients to visit and experience the services that will be offered. One of the feedbacks we received is an interest in a holistic approach to wellbeing that looks after the care model before, during and after treatment. Therefore, we are currently running a pilot lifestyle medicine program for our breast cancer patients.   Such feedback channels are key enablers in delivering tailored and world-class oncology care at home, and as a patient-centric organization our patients and their families provide invaluable input in designing this elevated care at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi."

A,"I believe in the power of entrepreneurship in Latin America. We started Latitud one year ago. Founders have raised tens of millions of dollars, people have met their co-founders, talent has been hired. It’s been a crazy amount of serendipity where LATAM founders come together with this spirit of helping each other. We are going live with our 4th cohort. Since only a small fraction of applicants have been women, we decided to ramp things up and make this cohort free for women. Join some of the guerreras/guerreiras from previous cohorts who are building game changing businesses. Let’s tag some of them below and there will also be a link to apply in the comments. You don’t have to have a fully baked idea to join, but you need to have bit ambitions. Also, if you are a man, you can still apply 😛. We are just trying to make an extra push to attract more women because they represent a small number of applicants. Let’s elevate the startup ecosystem together uniting all of Latin America. #latitud #startups #latam #vamoslatam #venturecapital"
