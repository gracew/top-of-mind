Early in my career, I was turned down by two FAANG companies. It stung, especially when I saw some of my classmates getting hired by these tech giants. I persisted and eventually landed at a small tech company focused on government contracting. Although I loved the variety of projects that I had the opportunity to participate in and enjoyed using tech to help people, I felt that I wasn't good enough because a tech giant didn't hire me. Flash forward to today. I've transitioned into engineering leadership and am responsible for cultivating the next generation of engineering leaders. I do cutting-edge work that positively impacts people's lives in meaningful ways. It took me years to figure it out, but I eventually realized that I love working in smaller companies that allow me to wear different hats and have a diversity of tasks. I love what I do and would never trade these opportunities. To the future rockstars out there who are just a few months out of college or boot camp, keep grinding, building, and learning.

C,"More than a decade ago, a group of engineering students and friends started working around the idea of building a social marketplace. Back then, most people were afraid of buying things over the internet. Our thinking was that the ‚Äúsocial distance‚Äù in the social graph could have been leveraged as a relevant indicator of trust, to eventually facilitate transactions. The marketplace never took off, but some of us continued running experiments around our merchant‚Äôs feedback, until we managed to understand that some of them wanted more personalization and control around their digital presence. After some prototyping, ""Nuvemshop | Tiendanube"" was born as a simple platform to help merchants build an online store, and to help them connect directly with their consumers. Ten years into the future, we are seeing D2C happen at a massive pace all over the world, and Nuvemshop has become the go-to platform for LATAM merchants to be successful. We have been privileged enough to partner with an amazing group of people: merchants, partners, advisors, investors, and team, and we now have even more resources to continue building infrastructure for the decade to come. The essence remains unchanged: to help everyone out there to convert passion projects into thriving businesses."

C,"I was delighted to receive a care package from the Coding it Forward fellowship, thanking me for mentoring and advising our country's next generation of civic technologists.

As fellows, these students have earned the privilege of being deliberate and thoughtful about their career path in ways that I never was, and I felt they deserved to know that. I highlighted my career trajectory so that they could avoid my mistakes and propel themselves only towards the success they deserve. Most of all, I wanted them to know that the pursuit of good, honest work that you can be proud of is always worth it. I'm honored to have played a small part in this summer cohort's story, and I look forward to seeing what they accomplish next."

A,"Last week was one of my first back at Lyft after over 18 weeks on parental leave.¬† Yep, 18 weeks.¬† For a dad.¬† Being able to take such a meaningful amount of time to celebrate the arrival of our daughter Izzy left me immensely grateful.¬† I feel so fortunate to work at a place that recognizes the profound impact on parents when they can be fully present with a newborn, on a company when their employees come back feeling refreshed and grateful after tending to what really matters and on society when parents are able to truly bond with their new arrival. While I certainly have Logan, John and Kristin to thank for instilling this mindset and culture into Lyft, I‚Äôm equally appreciative of the support I‚Äôve received at every level of the organization - from peers, direct reports, skip levels and casual office passersby. ¬† This encouragement had a meaningful effect on me - to silence the societal stigma about men stepping away from work for their families and to help push back against my own tendencies. And thanks to all this support, I also came to realize that my leave was a part of something much bigger - that it wasn‚Äôt just important to everyone that I take time with my growing family - but also that I set the right tone so that others would feel comfortable doing so when their time came. ¬† To do my small part to help normalize time with family.

So my advocacy is mostly a grateful dad saying that it ‚Äúmeant a lot‚Äù and that being able to take real time away from fast-paced job and a team of nearly 30 is a rare gift that's had an unforgettable impact. ¬† Finally, I wouldn't even be talking about this without my incredible team shouldering the burden during my leave, no questions asked. ¬† Christopher, Lamont, Michael, Kevin - I‚Äôm eternally grateful!"

A,"It's been absolutely gut-wrenching to witness the scenes of chaos and desperation play out in Afghanistan over the past few days. From 2005-2012, Afghanistan was the primary focus of my career - as an Army infantry officer in a frontline unit deployed to one of the most violent regions of the country and subsequently as a civilian field researcher/consultant focused on economic development. Over the years, I've made deep friendships with Afghans of many different stripes - interpreters, security forces, local leaders, journalists, entrepreneurs, and their families. The people are incredible, their culture is beautiful, and their potential is unlimited. Moreover, their perseverance amidst decades of war, courage in the face of daily threats to their lives and livelihoods, and commitment to a better future is truly inspirational. Unfortunately, their leadership largely did not embody these qualities and ended up failing and betraying them. The US role was a very mixed bag. There's plenty of blame to go around. But I'll save my political analysis for another platform and another time. Because first and foremost, the complete bungling of our withdrawal is creating a human tragedy of the highest order. Infuriating in how avoidable it was, but still not too late to fix. In recent days, I and many other veterans are doing our best to help terrified Afghan friends urgently confronted with terrible choices - risking their lives to travel to Kabul Airport in the slim hopes of getting a ticket out of the country or hunkering down in their homes, anxiously awaiting the inevitable Taliban to knock on their door, and hoping for the best/preparing for the worst. Given the current state of affairs, the US must urgently fix our completely broken Special Immigrant Visa program, urgently increase the number of available slots, and urgently evacuate not just US personnel but additionally our highly vulnerable Afghan allies. The public is watching. The world is watching. History is watching."

COVID, and more importantly the government response to the pandemic, simply compounded that uncertainty.

""Cash and short-term investments on corporate balance sheets globally are at an all-time high of $6.84 trillion, according to data from S&P Global, extrapolated from second-quarter earnings reports.

A,"A couple years back, revenue-based financing (RBF) was starting to pick up some steam and garner a lot of interest in the media and with Founders. The hype had hit! As the anti-Hype Man I seemingly have become, I built and shared an open-source RBF model meant to help folks actually understand core RBF mechanics. I also wrote a pretty comprehensive post on RBF: https://lnkd.in/gTX7c3c4 Since then, I‚Äôve connected with a steady stream of folks who have questions on the model and RBF in general. It‚Äôs been a decent enough evergreen marketing asset that seems to have provided folks with some intel they didn‚Äôt previously have. Kind of what I expected it to do, so all good. In the past few weeks, something I didn‚Äôt expect has happened a few times. People starting up new RBF funds have reached out because they‚Äôve run across the model. So what? Someone wants to glom on to my experience and milk me for information? Don‚Äôt be such a skeptic. This outreach was unique in that it came from groups on 3 continents, all of whom are looking to deploy RBF to deliver impact while generating strong financial returns. One group is in South Africa - I spent a month there 12 years ago, loved it. Maybe this can get me back over there. One is supporting refugees in Georgia - I used to volunteer with the refugee community in Denver. Have not done so in years, maybe this can be a catalyst to get me back into it. One is in Colombia - My wife‚Äôs family is from Colombia. My kids are 1/4th Colombian. I have a Colombian national team soccer kit. Sure, why not hop on a call?! Point being, these interactions are of interest not only b/c of their unexpectedness (no need to look it up, I did, it‚Äôs a word) but more so b/c they are not my day-to-day, not really overlapping with Bigfoot, and have some tangential relationship to my personal life. So, I‚Äôve determined they‚Äôre worth a bit of my time to see if I can provide some support beyond a spreadsheet and blog post I put on the internet 2 years ago. Anyways, it got me thinking a bit about unexpected benefits that can come along with sharing your knowledge and experience (a scary thing for a lot of us). Beyond building brand awareness and advocacy, which the model has done, it‚Äôs now serving as a mechanism for me and our team to potentially involve ourselves with people and missions that span well beyond Bigfoot‚Äôs focus. We‚Äôre not going to lend in Africa or South America or to a refugee run manufacturing company. It‚Äôs just not what we do. But, we have some operational know-how that may enable us to contribute to groups directly doing so. I think that‚Äôs pretty cool.¬† You never know what can happen when you take a bit of time to share your knowledge in a practical format. You may just help others succeed and open up some new avenues for your own growth. #capitalraising #financeandeconomy #finance #financialmodeling #revenuebasedfinancing Bigfoot Capital"

A,"Companies are pouring millions into ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù initiatives ‚Äî but a high percentage of those fail to pay off. That‚Äôs because companies put the cart before the horse, focusing on a specific technology (‚Äúwe need a machine-learning strategy!‚Äù) rather than doing the hard work of fitting the change into the overall business strategy first. Not only should they align tech investments with business goal, they should also lean more on insider knowledge than outside consultants, acknowledge fears about job loss that those insiders may have, develop deep knowledge of how changes will affect customer experience, and use experimentation, prototyping, etc. to facilitate change. https://lnkd.in/d9EB44XY #technology #digitaltransformation #artificialintelligence #innovation #machinelearning #ai"

A,"How temporary will the recent and sharp decline in consumer sentiment be due to the rise of the Delta variant? We don't know. According to the University of Michigan's results from its early August survey: ""Consumers have correctly reasoned that the economy's performance will be diminished over the next several months, but the extraordinary surge in negative economic assessments also reflects an emotional response, mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end. In the months ahead, it is likely that consumers will again voice more reasonable expectations, and with control of the Delta variant, shift toward outright optimism."" Civic Science is also showing increased concern with their own August data: ""This week, nearly 80% of the population is concerned about the variant ‚Äì with nearly half reporting they are 'very concerned'...Employers and businesses are beginning to require proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test for employees to return to work. As of right now, more adults agree than disagree that proof of COVID-19 vaccination should be required to go to work."" Meanwhile, over at Morning Consult for the month of July: ""Overall, sentiment declined in 41 of 50 states. With consumer sentiment rising in only eight states, July marks the worst month for state-level gains since November 2020 when the third wave was roaring through the U.S. and only four states experienced an increase in consumer confidence."" However, The Conference Board's own Consumer Confidence Index for July showed no such change (probably because their own survey was taken before the rise in Delta variants became daily news): ""Consumers‚Äô appraisal of present-day conditions held steady, suggesting economic growth in Q3 is off to a strong start. Consumers‚Äô optimism about the short-term outlook didn‚Äôt waver, and they continued to expect that business conditions, jobs, and personal financial prospects will improve."" It wouldn't surprise me to find out that the sharp drop in August is due largely to pandemic fatigue, with many consumers wondering, ""Is this ever going to end?"" Yes, but because the country didn't come together to achieve herd immunity quickly, while the pandemic will end, Covid-19 is here to stay, and will likely be managed appropriately as it becomes less lethal.

C,"More than a decade ago, a group of engineering students and friends started working around the idea of building a social marketplace. Back then, most people were afraid of buying things over the internet. Our thinking was that the ‚Äúsocial distance‚Äù in the social graph could have been leveraged as a relevant indicator of trust, to eventually facilitate transactions. The marketplace never took off, but some of us continued running experiments around our merchant‚Äôs feedback, until we managed to understand that some of them wanted more personalization and control around their digital presence. After some prototyping, ""Nuvemshop | Tiendanube"" was born as a simple platform to help merchants build an online store, and to help them connect directly with their consumers. Ten years into the future, we are seeing D2C happen at a massive pace all over the world, and Nuvemshop has become the go-to platform for LATAM merchants to be successful. We have been privileged enough to partner with an amazing group of people: merchants, partners, advisors, investors, and team, and we now have even more resources to continue building infrastructure for the decade to come. The essence remains unchanged: to help everyone out there to convert passion projects into thriving businesses."

A,"A Chinese gene company selling #prenatal tests around the world developed them in collaboration with the country's #military and is using them to collect #genetic #data from millions of #women for sweeping research on the traits of populations, a #Reuters review of scientific papers and company statements found. DNA data collected from prenatal tests on women outside China has been found to be also stored in China‚Äôs government-funded #gene #database, one of the world‚Äôs largest, the company confirmed. BGI, in which the Shenzhen city government and Beijing's largest state investment vehicle¬†took stakes¬†in 2014, runs that gene bank. #NATO has warned China's assertive behavior is a systemic challenge, and #Beijing has drawn sanctions for alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang and stepped up a national security crackdown in Hong Kong.¬†¬† Being able to understand how physical characteristics relate to a gene ‚Äì and thus figuring out what genes actually do ‚Äì ‚Äúreally is the cutting edge of genomics,‚Äù said Puglisi, who worked on biosecurity issues in the U.S. government. ‚ÄúWhen you can combine large amounts of #genomic #data ‚Äì including¬†mothers and their unborn children ‚Äì with their medical data and history, it is really powerful.‚Äù Reuters reviewed more than 100 documents, from research papers to marketing materials, to determine the scope of data being captured by BGI through its prenatal tests, how it is using this in its research and its military collaboration. Reuters also interviewed more than two dozen scientists and experts in genetic law, including researchers who worked with the company, as well as four women, in Poland, Spain and Thailand, who took the tests. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center ( #NCSC) told Reuters in response to this report that it had ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù over how genetic data is ‚Äúcollected, transmitted, stored and used‚Äù by China‚Äôs government and companies.¬† The NCSC, which issues public warnings on intelligence threats to the United States,¬†has said¬†China‚Äôs collection of healthcare data from America poses serious risks, not only to privacy, but also to U.S. economic and national security. It urged health institutions to carefully assess risks associated with sharing such data with Chinese companies, and for patients to be told about the ‚Äúvalue and sensitivity‚Äù of their genetic information ‚Äì and the risks associated with turning it over. Women taking the #NIFTY test outside China should be concerned about the privacy terms that allow data to be shared with Chinese national #security agencies, the center said. ‚ÄúNon-invasive #prenatal testing kits marketed by Chinese biotech firms serve an important medical function, but they can also provide another mechanism for the #People‚ÄôsRepublicChina and Chinese biotech companies to collect genetic and genomic data from around the globe,‚Äù the center said."

A,"Lessons in sustaining their economy, their businesses, and keeping their community healthy during the pandemic: ‚Äúwith many other industries hurting in a state largely built on seasonal industries, closing salmon fishing season‚Äî which is estimated by a recent study to bring in $2 billion annually‚Äîwould have resulted in a wide-reaching economic blow. Safety protocols were finally agreed on just weeks before the start of the season. Testing, travel regulations, quarantining, and masking were mandated, and the measures were put in place in all areas of the fishery. Processing plants operated strictly as closed campuses. Fishermen were quarantined on their boats in the boatyards. Once a crew was at sea, it stayed at sea; there was no returning to the docks or sending people into town. The port was closed to the public‚Äîas it continued to be this year. When a crew aboard a fishing vessel contracted COVID-19 in Dillingham, the boat was hauled into the boatyard and surrounded with yellow caution tape like a crime scene. With all the safety measures in place, it was just a matter of waiting. ‚ÄúWe were waiting for the big burst to happen,‚Äù says Tilden. ‚ÄúBut it didn‚Äôt happen."" #COVID #COMMUNITY National Geographic #fishing"

Fly over buildings and obstacles, and see-through smoke with thermal cameras to help prioritize targets Stream live video intelligence back to command centers to align teams and eliminate the uncertainty. Leverage high-resolution cameras to remotely monitor remaining threats and document damage for future analysis. A drone swarm using a relocatable servicing platform could be instantly deployed enabling a quick response and used both during the day and at night, in all visibility conditions, without the requirement of a nearby available water basin. Consider that in most countries, for safety reasons, firefighting aircraft can only fly during the day and are able to perform a limited number of water drops per hour due to the distance from a water refueling site.

Yet, there is still a disconnect between research and production environments to ensure a reliable experience for customers and engineers alike.

I count inventory at our warehouse during our annual inventory count. And I work trade shows along with the rest of our small but mighty team ‚Äì pushing to sell pecan log rolls and turn this scrappy company around, one new retail account at a time. I‚Äôm posting this so other women who see the picture-perfect moments on LinkedIn know that there are lots of unglamorous moments behind-the-scenes.¬†But, flashy or not, it‚Äôs those moments that count."

C,"After several years of working in industry at Tripadvisor and Niantic, Inc., I am excited to announce that this Fall I will be starting a Master of Science in Data Science at Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS) at Harvard University. I will focus on ethical/bias implications in ML, AI fairness, and interpretable machine learning. As a first-generation college graduate from a low-income refugee family raised in Las Vegas during the 2008 financial crisis, survival in America felt precarious, high-stakes, and at times impossible all at once. So much hung in the balance with every step I took. The support of family, friends, colleagues, professors, organizing community, and mentors whose collective belief in me outmeasured my own made each stride feel lighter and possible. Not in my or my ancestors‚Äô wildest dreams would I imagine that steps along that winding path would lead me through Harvard University's ivory gates and beyond. In Vietnamese, there is a proverb that goes: ""ƒÇn qu·∫£ nh·ªõ k·∫ª tr·ªìng c√¢y."" This directly translates to ‚Äî ""When eating fruit, think of those who planted the tree.""

A,"Is ego-dissolution always a positive experience? Dread of ego-dissolution is one of the factors of the Altered States Questionnaire (Dittrich, 1998) which is one of the most widely used subjective measures of the psychedelic state. Dread of ego-dissolution is considered to entice negative, anxiety laden experiences and are often associated with what people might label as ‚Äúbad trips‚Äù. It includes items measuring negatively experienced depersonalisation, cognitive disturbances, paranoia and anxiety over loss of thought and body control. It is also important to note that although this factor is named dread of ego-dissolution, it only captures limited aspects of the ego-dissolution experience. In a study conducted by Roseman, Nutt & Carhart-Harris (2018), the dread of ego-dissolution factor in psilocybin sessions was found to be negatively related to long-term positive outcomes in treatment-resistant depression. On the other hand, psilocybin experiences that shared features with the Oceanic Boundlessness factor of the scale (and are more similar to the mystical-type experience) were found to be more positively related to long-term positive outcomes. Dread of ego-dissolution was reported less than the feelings of unity associated with Oceanic Boundlessness.
